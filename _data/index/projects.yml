- name: AUTO-ONTO
  gh_user: Abhinand20
  repo: AUTO-ONTO
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/auto-onto.jpeg
  desc: Tool to automatically extract keywords from corpus spanning various domains and form heirarchical relationships (Ontology) between them. This tool helped me bag the 1st place at Deloitte's NLP hackathon.

- name: cpPyox
  gh_user: Abhinand20
  repo: cpPyox
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/cpPyox.png
  desc: A high-level dynamically typed interpreted language with python-like features implemented on a C++ backend. This project is mainly for deepening my understanding of programming language design.

- name: Self-supervised Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation
  gh_user: Abhinand20
  repo: 
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/research.png 
  desc: A novel & effective approach to the tackle the challenging task of automatically segmenting regions in MRI/CT scans in a few-shot setting with very little training data. Code and research paper will be made public soon!

- name: MathFormer
  gh_user: Abhinand20
  repo: MathFormer
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/mathformer.png
  desc: A transformer based light-weight model that can solve mathematical equations containing single variable factored polynomials with ~99% accuracy. This project helped me learn a lot about how modern-day NLP tasks are solved efficiently using Transformers and the Attention mechanism.

- name: Secure-AES
  gh_user: Abhinand20
  repo: Secure-AES
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/aes.png # TO ADD
  desc: Modern embedded systems have highly secure software, however, research suggests that they are extremely vulnerable to hardware attacks. Secure-AES is a novel approach to produce tamper-resistant chips. More information and paper is at my github!
