  desc: Welcome to my portfolio! I'm a graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in Computer Systems and Software Engineering, with a keen interest in Deep Learning research. I bring over a year of professional software engineering experience, gained through full-time work in the industry. My passion for innovation led me to explore and validate new ideas, and I enjoy writing about my discoveries in Software Systems and Machine Learning on my <a src="">blog</a>. I'm always eager to connect on <a src="">LinkedIn</a> to discuss my work, projects, and share insights with fellow enthusiasts. Collaboration is essential in the tech world, and I value learning from others while contributing to the community. I also find joy in making music and playing the guitar during my free time. It's a creative outlet that complements my problem-solving mindset. <br> Do you know how many guitars a guitarist shoud buy? <br> "One more"
